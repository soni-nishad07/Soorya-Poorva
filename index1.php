                    </h2>
                    <p>I am Manjunath V. Soorya, a dedicated natural and organic farmer since childhood. I continue to
                        grow a wide variety of food items organically. Between 1994 and 2000, I received training from
                        the Indo-Netherlands Government's AME (Agriculture Man Ecology) initiative, which organized
                        organic farming groups in South End Circle, Jayanagar. During this time, I cultivated vegetables
                        on 20 guntas of land in Ghattahalli and 1.5 acres in Chintalamadivala, using only natural inputs
                        such as cow dung, urine, milk, buttermilk, ghee, neem cake, pongamia cake, pongamia oil, and
                        neem oil for pest control.
                    </p>
                    <p>In 2000, when AME relocated to Raichur, we were left without guidance on natural farming. To
                        address environmental issues like soil, food, air, and water pollution, I founded the NGO
                        “Raithapi Bhoo-Maalikara Swayam Seva Sangha” on January 11, 2018. I actively encourage local
                        farmers to transition to organic farming and abandon chemical fertilizers and pesticides.
                        However, many are reluctant to change due to the immediate profits from chemical farming. I
                        believe it’s essential for us to transform ourselves first before we can inspire others to
                        embrace sustainable practices.</p>

                      <b>Our Oxygen</b>
                      <p>Oxygen levels in our environment can only be restored by increasing the number of plants and
                          trees. In 2002, the Indian government permitted farmers to cultivate red and sandalwood. The
                          forest department in every taluk has initiated plans to promote agroforestry, encouraging
                          farmers to plant more trees to enhance oxygen production and combat global warming.</p>

                      <b>Our Water</b>
                      <p>
                          Indian farmers often use excessive chemicals and pesticides, which degrade soil quality and
                          make it unsuitable for cultivation. As a result, rainfall has decreased, leading to
                          insufficient groundwater recharge and depletion of our water sources. Trees and plants play
                          a crucial role in retaining water and facilitating its penetration into the ground.

                      <b>Our Food</b>
                      <p>
                          Dear friends, consider purchasing farmland with us to grow your own healthy food, ensuring a
                          nutritious lifestyle for generations to come. This venture not only promotes health but also
                          provides opportunities for additional income and financial growth.

                      <b>Our Oil</b>
                      <p>
                          In today’s world, many people consume polluted food. For instance, oil companies often
                          extract just 25% of original oil seeds, mixing the remaining 75% with paraffin, white oil,
                          mineral oil, and petroleum waste products. These harmful additives are linked to serious
                          health issues, including cancer and heart disease, and negatively impact longevity.
                      </p>

                  <div class="a_l">
                      <b>Our Milk</b>
                      <p>
                          High-Production (HF) and Jersey cows produce A1 milk, often enhanced by hormone induction.
                          In contrast, indigenous breeds such as Jharwari, Killari, Hallikar, Malenad Gidda, Gir,
                          Ongole, and Kangrej produce A2 milk, which is far healthier for our children. Choosing A2
                          milk supports better health and promotes the welfare of our native breeds.
