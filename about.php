                    <p>I am Manjunath V. Soorya, a dedicated natural and organic farmer since childhood. I continue to
                        grow a wide variety of food items organically. Between 1994 and 2000, I received training from
                        the Indo-Netherlands Government's AME (Agriculture Man Ecology) initiative, which organized
                        organic farming groups in South End Circle, Jayanagar. During this time, I cultivated vegetables
                        on 20 guntas of land in Ghattahalli and 1.5 acres in Chintalamadivala, using only natural inputs
                        such as cow dung, urine, milk, buttermilk, ghee, neem cake, pongamia cake, pongamia oil, and
                        neem oil for pest control. In 2000, when AME relocated to Raichur, we were left without guidance
                        on natural farming. To address environmental issues like soil, food, air, and water pollution, I
                        founded the NGO “Raithapi Bhoo-Maalikara Swayam Seva Sangha” on January 11, 2018. I actively
                        encourage local farmers to transition to organic farming and abandon chemical fertilizers and
                        pesticides. However, many are reluctant to change due to the immediate profits from chemical
                        farming. I believe it’s essential for us to transform ourselves first before we can inspire
                        others to embrace sustainable practices.</p>

                <b>Our Oxygen</b>
                <p>Oxygen levels in our environment can only be restored by increasing the number of plants and
                    trees. In 2002, the Indian government permitted farmers to cultivate red and sandalwood. The
                    forest department in every taluk has initiated plans to promote agroforestry, encouraging
                    farmers to plant more trees to enhance oxygen production and combat global warming.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="a_l">
                <b>Our Water</b>
                <p>
                    Indian farmers often use excessive chemicals and pesticides, which degrade soil quality and
                    make it unsuitable for cultivation. As a result, rainfall has decreased, leading to
                    insufficient groundwater recharge and depletion of our water sources. Trees and plants play
                    a crucial role in retaining water and facilitating its penetration into the ground.

                <p>
                    Dear friends, consider purchasing farmland with us to grow your own healthy food, ensuring a
                    nutritious lifestyle for generations to come. This venture not only promotes health but also
                    provides opportunities for additional income and financial growth.

            <div class="a_l">
                <b>Our Oil</b>
                <p>
                    In today’s world, many people consume polluted food. For instance, oil companies often
                    extract just 25% of original oil seeds, mixing the remaining 75% with paraffin, white oil,
                    mineral oil, and petroleum waste products. These harmful additives are linked to serious
                    health issues, including cancer and heart disease, and negatively impact longevity.

            <div class="a_l">
                <b>Our Milk</b>
                <p>
                    High-Production (HF) and Jersey cows produce A1 milk, often enhanced by hormone induction.
                    In contrast, indigenous breeds such as Jharwari, Killari, Hallikar, Malenad Gidda, Gir,
                    Ongole, and Kangrej produce A2 milk, which is far healthier for our children. Choosing A2
                    milk supports better health and promotes the welfare of our native breeds.

                    <p class="text-white">Our ancestors cultivated their own farmland, growing a diverse range of crops, including vegetables, fruits, and cereals. Their farming practices were entirely natural; they avoided chemicals and relied on traditional inputs such as cow dung, urine, milk, buttermilk, butter, ghee, green manures, and other organic waste. This holistic approach contributed to their remarkable longevity, with many individuals living up to 100 years.
                    I am Manjunath V. Soorya, the proprietor of Soorya Properties and Management. I have always dreamed of making a significant impact in the real estate business, which led me to develop the concept of "My Dream Natural Weekend Villa Farmhouse." This upcoming project aims to transform 1,000 acres of land across 31 districts in Karnataka into natural and organic farmland. Our approach is rooted in ancestral farming practices, and we will offer contract-based management of these properties to investors and landowners.</p>
